Assignment 1 for ITCY583 - Lecture 1 Thanapon Noraset
1. Download the (old) CVE data from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/exploring-cybersecurity-risk-vi
a-2022-cisa-vulne
2. Create a new Jupyter notebook (Colab or Local)
3. Write a program that reads one file of the CVE data (e.g.,
2022-12-09-enriched.csv) and then shows number of security vulnerabilities
by severity.
We will properly introduce you to Python tools for this later, but this should be easy
if you use some generative AI to help you code. Please make sure you understand
your own code.
